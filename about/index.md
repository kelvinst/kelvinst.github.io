title: A little about me
---

So, I'm not good in say about me, then: my name is Kelvin Stinghen. I am Brazilian, and currently residing at Blumenau, SC (Brazil), but born in the little village of Massaranduba, SC (Brazil too). Proudly married with Juliana Andrade.

I'm am an enthusiast developer and love the open source community, in special the ruby community. I love to discover new technologies and study the old ones, always looking for become a better developer.

So, beyond the developer me, you will see a christian, a guitar player, a sports enthusiast, an old-scholl gamer and many other personal things.

Maybe someday I'll improve a little this page, but today I'm not with time for think about. ![emoji](https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smiley.png)
