title: A little about me
---

So, I'm not good in say about me, then: my name is Kelvin Stinghen. I am Brazilian, and currently residing at Blumenau, SC (Brazil), but born in the litlle village of Massaranduba, SC (Brazil too). I'm proudly married with Juliana Andrade, who was a hard work to convince in accept my last name as her last name too, but she accepted at the end.

So, I'm am an enthusiast developer and love the open source community, in special the ruby community. I love to discover new things and study the old ones.

So, maybe someday I'll improve a little this page, but today I'm not with time for think about. ![emoji](https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smiley.png)
