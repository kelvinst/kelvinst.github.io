title: Rails Installer - Site Translator
---

Hi.

Once upon a time, a young brazilian guy felt he needs to do something more useful to the world. So, he translated a site to his language.

Nice to meet you, I'm that guy. And the lucky site was the [Rails Installer site](http://railsinstaller.org/). But the guy (me) left a gift pretty more interesting that only the translation: the hability for YOU to continue this awesome history!

Right, enough fables. I refactor the site to support translations. If you want to translate it to your language, follow these steps:

- Go to the [site repository](https://github.com/railsinstaller/website)
- Fork it!
- Clone it!
- Copy the [config/locales/en.yml](https://github.com/railsinstaller/website/blob/master/config/locales/en.yml) file and paste to the same folder.
- Rename the new file to your language abbreviation (e.g. **es.yml** for spanish).
- Open, the file, and translate the texts!
- Commit the file.
- Push it!
- Open a pull request to the main repository.
- Be happy and die with the assurance that this world will not forget you (or not).

About the story: if you are asking yourself if this was irony, maybe it's a little, but this was my first step in the open-source community, and I'm really very proud of it. Even that's a little step, finally, I'M IN!

And, if you'd never heard about it, I advise you to really take a look at [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org/). If you are using Rails with Windows, you will never regret this.

By now, it's this, bye.
