Hi! Thank you for being at here! ![smiley](https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smiley.png)

My name is Kelvin Stinghen, and I'm an enthusiast developer from Brazil. Currently residing at Blumenau, SC, but born in the litlle village of Massaranduba, SC.

I'm addicted with ruby development and love the open source community. Professionally (at companies), I had experiences with Java, C, Delphi, and some other languages that doesn't need to be exposed here.

And, about the blog: hopefully, in the future, I'll be working on it.

The end.
