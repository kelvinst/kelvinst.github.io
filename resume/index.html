<h3 id='biography'>Biography</h3>
<p>I’m an enthusiast Ruby on Rails developer. I am always searching for better ways to increase my products and the ecosystem around them, like the open source projects I use daily.</p>

<p>When you don’t find me programming, you’ll find me reading, principally christian books, practicing sports as soccer or running, or having a happy hour with my friends and my wife.</p>
<h3 id='education'>Education</h3>
<p><strong>FURB</strong> — <em>Blumenau, SC, Brazil</em><br /> <em>Feb ‘10 - Present</em><br /> Computer science bachelorhood</p>
<h3 id='skills'>Skills</h3>
<p>Professionally I worked on many languages and tools, first with Delphi legacy products, converting a C application to Java, then writing new products in Java. And studying at the university, it was not very different, where the homeworks, at most, must be written in Java.</p>

<p>So, until the end of 2012, I was a typical Java/Delphi programmer, with some steps into other languages for study purposes, but nothing more deep than this. Then, in some shiny day of 2013, I’ve made a fork in my developer’s life, when I start to contribute actively in open source projects, and start to dive in this awesome community and discover every day more, what this world can teach me.</p>

<p>Today I’m working full time with ruby products. Building some form the scratch, and even giving support on old legacy products.</p>

<p>Improve my programming skills was always my objective, and with this new step, I am finding even more ways to make me better, and reach better solutions for everything I am doing, even using other languages.</p>

<p>If you want to know about my open-source contributions, take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/kelvinst">GitHub account</a> or read my <a href="http://osrc.dfm.io/kelvinst">Open Source Report Card</a>. If you want to know some of my achievements as a developer in GitHub, check my <a href="https://coderwall.com/kelvinst">CoderWall account</a>. And if you want to know somethings that I know about web development, check my <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/kelvinst">Code School Report Card</a>.</p>

<p>About idioms, I speak fluently brazilian portuguese (obviously), english in advanced level, and german at a very basic level.</p>

<p>As a craftsman rubyist on ateliware’s team, I was responsible by implement many custom-made Ruby on Rails applications from scratch, as well as maintaining them. Some of them were:</p>

<li>A time tracking and meeting room management tool for a coworking office, integrating with a simple brazilian online ERP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of them, me and some teammates built from scratch, and some of them were built in a record time, like the time tracking for coworking, that was built in just 2 weeks of work.</p>

<p>Actually, I am one of the developers of <a href="http://www.pipefy.com">Pipefy</a>, a BPM tool based on kanban principles.</p>
