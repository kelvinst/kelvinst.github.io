<h3 id='biography'>Biography</h3>
<p>I’m an enthusiast developer coursing Computer Science at FURB. And my primary studies now still on web development with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Professionaly speaking, I mainly worked with Java and Delphi development, but in the case of interests, I really fall in love with Ruby, that is the main cause of my open source world’s introduction.</p>

<p>When you don’t find me programming, you’ll find me reading, principally christian books, practicing sports as soccer or running, or having a happy hour with my friends and my wife.</p>
<h3 id='education'>Education</h3>
<p><strong>FURB</strong> — <em>Blumenau, SC, Brazil</em><br /> <em>Feb ‘10 - Present</em><br /> Computer science bachelorhood</p>
<h3 id='skills'>Skills</h3>
<p>Professionally I worked on many languages, first with Delphi legacy products, then converting a C application to Java, then writing new products in Java. And studying at the university, it was not very different, where the homeworks, at most, must be written in Java.</p>

<p>So, until the end of 2012, I was a typical Java/Delphi programmer, with some steps into other languages for study purposes, but nothing more deep than this. Then, in some shiny day of 2013, I’ve made a fork in my developer’s life, when I start to contribute actively in open source projects, and start to dive in this awesome Ruby community and discover every day more, what this world can teach me.</p>

<p>Improve my programming skills was always my objective, and with Ruby, I am finding even more ways to make me better, and discuss better solutions for everything I am doing.</p>

<p>If you want to know about my open-source contributions, take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/kelvinst">GitHub account</a> or read my <a href="http://osrc.dfm.io/kelvinst">Open Source Report Card</a>. If you want to know some of my achievements as a developer in GitHub, check my <a href="https://coderwall.com/kelvinst">CoderWall account</a>. And if you want to know somethings that I know about web development, check my <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/kelvinst">Code School Report Card</a>.</p>

<p>About idioms, I speak fluently brazilian portuguese (obviously), english in advanced level, and german at a very basic level.</p>

<p>After a new promotion and the end of the architectural restructuring, I was move to the maintenance team, to support the adaptation with the new architecture.

<p>After the promotion, I was moved to a team that was responsible to make an architectural restructuring to support a new way to install the Senior distributed system, which have pretty more complex implementations than in the internationalization project. In this post, I was charged to convert an Windows CGI application, written in C, to a Java servlet, I have made the load balancer for the Senior distrubuted system, I help to write a new configuration API to the legacy products, and help to built the new installer from the ground up.</p>
