<h3 id="biography">Biography</h3>

I’m an enthusiast Ruby on Rails developer. I am always searching for better ways to increase my products and the ecosystem around them, like the open source projects I use daily.

When you don’t find me programming, you’ll find me reading, principally christian books, practicing sports as soccer or running, or having a happy hour with my friends and my wife.

<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>

Professionally I worked on many languages and tools, first with Delphi legacy products, converting a C application to Java, then writing new products in Java. And studying at the university, it was not very different, where the homeworks, at most, must be written in Java.

So, until the end of 2012, I was a typical Java/Delphi programmer, with some steps into other languages for study purposes, but nothing more deep than this. Then, in some shiny day of 2013, I've made a fork in my developer's life, when I start to contribute actively in open source projects, and start to dive in this awesome community and discover every day more, what this world can teach me.

Today I'm working full time with ruby products. Building some form the scratch, and even giving support on old legacy products.

Improve my programming skills was always my objective, and with this new step, I am finding even more ways to make me better, and reach better solutions for everything I am doing, even using other languages.

As a craftsman rubyist on ateliware's team, I was responsible by implement many custom-made Ruby on Rails applications from scratch, as well as maintaining them. Some of them were:

- A simple SFMS app for a well known brazilian food industry, integrating with another well known ERP on Brazil,
- A time tracking and meeting room management tool for a coworking office, integrating with a simple brazilian online ERP.

Each of them, me and some teammates built from scratch, and some of them were built in a record time, like the time tracking for coworking, that was built in just 2 weeks of work.

Actually, I am one of the developers of [Pipefy](http://www.pipefy.com), a BPM tool based on kanban principles.
