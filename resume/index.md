<h3 id="biography">Biography</h3>

I'm an enthusiast developer coursing Computer Science at FURB. And my primary studies now still on web development with Ruby on Rails. 

Professionaly speaking, I mainly worked with Java and Delphi development, but in the case of interests, I really fall in love with Ruby, that is the main cause of my open source world's introduction.

When you don't find me programming, you'll find me reading, principally christian books, practicing sports as soccer or running, or having a happy hour with my friends and my wife.

Professionally I worked on many languages, first with Delphi legacy products, then converting a C application to Java, then writing new products in Java. And studying at the university, it was not very different, where the homeworks, at most, must be written in Java.

So, until the end of 2012, I was a typical Java/Delphi programmer, with some steps into other languages for study purposes, but nothing more deep than this. Then, in some shiny day of 2013, I've made a fork in my developer's life, when I start to contribute actively in open source projects, and start to dive in this awesome Ruby community and discover every day more, what this world can teach me.

Improve my programming skills was always my objective, and with Ruby, I am finding even more ways to make me better, and discuss better solutions for everything I am doing.
